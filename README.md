## I like NeoVim and Tmux

### Run install script
`./install`

### NeoVim
When first opening `nvim` you may have to run `:PackerSync`

#### NeoVim Principles

*`<leader>` vs `;` vs `<C-*>`*
Still figuring this out, but I think the deliniation I'm leaning towards is:
- `<leader>` is meant for "project" wide action
- `;` is meant for acting on the current buffer
- `<C-*>` may be better as a "current line" action..maybe, I still like `<C-f>` for "find in file"
